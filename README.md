a study guide for course pre-work.

# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This prework allowed us to get a first hand experience at coding where we learned about the different front end languages (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript)  and Git, and then put them to use.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is a website in progress that have different sections (HTML, CSS, Javascript, & Git) with quick notes to remind coders of what each section is about. This website is essentially used as a word document/notebook for coders to take notes on and refer to when needed while in bootcamp. Once this website is published, it can be shared with other fellow coders to use as well.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
